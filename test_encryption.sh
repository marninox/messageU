echo "Encryption and Key Exchange Feature Implementation:"
echo "================================================="
echo "✓ Client-side Crypto Implementation:"
echo "  - Added RSA key pair generation (2048-bit)"
echo "  - Added AES-128-CBC encryption/decryption with zero IV"
echo "  - Added symmetric key generation and storage"
echo "  - Added RSA encryption/decryption for key exchange"
echo "  - Added key exchange message creation and processing"
echo ""
echo "✓ Protocol Extensions:"
echo "  - Added SEND_SYMMETRIC_KEY (5004) and SYMMETRIC_KEY_RESPONSE (5005) codes"
echo "  - Added createSendSymmetricKeyRequest() method"
echo "  - Added isSymmetricKeyReceived() method"
echo "  - Added getSymmetricKeyData() method"
echo ""
echo "✓ Message Flow Integration:"
echo "  - Send message now checks for symmetric key"
echo "  - Automatically initiates key exchange if needed"
echo "  - Messages are encrypted with AES before sending"
echo "  - Received messages are decrypted with AES"
echo "  - Key exchange uses RSA for secure key transmission"
echo ""
echo "✓ Crypto++ Integration:"
echo "  - RSA key generation and management"
echo "  - AES-128-CBC encryption with zero IV"
echo "  - Secure random number generation"
echo "  - Base64 encoding/decoding support"
echo ""
echo "✓ Security Features:"
echo "  - Symmetric keys are generated randomly for each recipient"
echo "  - Keys are encrypted with recipient's public RSA key"
echo "  - Messages are encrypted with AES-128-CBC"
echo "  - Zero IV as specified in requirements"
echo ""
echo "✓ Testing:"
echo "  - Client compiles successfully with Crypto++"
echo "  - All cryptographic methods implemented"
echo "  - Protocol extensions added"
echo "  - Message flow integrated with encryption"
echo ""
echo "To test the encryption functionality:"
echo "1. Run: ./messageu_client"
echo "2. Select option 5 (Send message)"
echo "3. Enter a recipient (e.g., 'newuser3')"
echo "4. The client will automatically:"
echo "   - Get the recipient's public key"
echo "   - Generate and send a symmetric key"
echo "   - Encrypt your message with AES"
echo "   - Send the encrypted message"
echo "5. Use option 4 (Get waiting messages) to see decrypted messages"
echo ""
echo "Note: This implementation provides end-to-end encryption where:"
echo "- Messages are encrypted with AES-128-CBC"
echo "- Symmetric keys are exchanged using RSA encryption"
echo "- The server never sees the plaintext messages"
echo "- Each recipient gets a unique symmetric key"
