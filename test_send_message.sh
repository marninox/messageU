echo "Send Message Feature Implementation:"
echo "=================================="
echo "✓ Server-side:"
echo "  - Added create_send_message_response() method to protocol handler"
echo "  - Added store_message() method to database handler"
echo "  - Updated handle_send_message_request() method in main server"
echo "  - Validates recipient exists before storing message"
echo "  - Stores messages with sender, recipient, type, and content"
echo ""
echo "✓ Client-side:"
echo "  - Added isSendMessageSuccess() method to check response type"
echo "  - Implemented sendMessage() method in MessageUClient"
echo "  - Prompts for recipient (ID or nickname) and message content"
echo "  - Displays success or error messages clearly"
echo ""
echo "✓ Testing:"
echo "  - Client compiles successfully"
echo "  - Server is running and ready to handle requests"
echo "  - Tested with valid recipient: successfully sends message"
echo "  - Tested with invalid recipient: correctly shows error"
echo "  - Messages are stored in database and can be retrieved"
echo ""
echo "✓ Protocol Format:"
echo "  - Request: recipient(255) + message_length(4) + message_content"
echo "  - Response: success/error message"
echo ""
echo "✓ Integration:"
echo "  - Send message feature works with waiting messages feature"
echo "  - Messages sent via 'Send message' can be retrieved via 'Get waiting messages'"

echo "To test interactively:"
echo "1. Run: ./messageu_client"
echo "2. Select option 5 (Send message)"
echo "3. Enter recipient (e.g., 'newuser3' or '9b0284e881665707')"
